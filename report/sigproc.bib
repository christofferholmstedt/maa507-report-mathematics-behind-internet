    Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of segmenting an image into regions. We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions.},

@article{trinder1998,
    Abstract = {The paper presents a knowledge-based method for automatic road extraction from aerial photography and high-resolution remotely sensed images. The method is based on Marr's theory of vision, which consists of low-level image processing for edge detection and linking, mid-level processing for the formation of road structure, and high-level processing for the recognition of roads. It uses a combined control strategy in which hypotheses are generated in a bottom-up mode and a top-down process is applied to predict the missing road segments. To describe road structures a generalized antiparallel pair is proposed. The hypotheses of road segments are generated based on the knowledge of their geometric and radiometric properties, which are expressed as rules in Prolog. They are verified using part–whole relationships between roads in high-resolution images and roads in low-resolution images and spatial relationships between verified road segments. Some results are presented in this paper.},

@article{lacoste2004,
    Abstract = {Marked point processes provide a rigorous framework to describe a scene by an unordered set of objects. The efficiency of this modeling has been shown on line network extraction with models manipulating interacting segments. In this paper, we extend this previous modeling to polylines composed of an unknown number of segments. Optimization is done via simulated annealing using a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. We accelerate the convergence of the algorithm by using appropriate proposal kernels. Results on aerial and satellite images show that this new model outperforms the previous one.},

    Abstract = {The capacity to detect linear features is central to image analysis, computer vision and pattern recognition and has practical applications in areas such as neurite outgrowth detection, retinal vessel extraction, skin hair removal, plant root analysis and road detection. Linear feature detection often represents the starting point for image segmentation and image interpretation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for linear feature detection using multiple directional non-maximum suppression with symmetry checking and gap linking. Given its low computational complexity, the algorithm is very fast. We show in several examples that it performs very well in terms of both sensitivity and continuity of detected linear features.},
