This report goes through the Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation algorithm
and its usefulness on aerial images for road recognition with the purpose of
automating the process to create maps. Written as a part of an advanced level course
this report will give the reader an introduction to some basics of digital
image processing, the algorithm and how it all comes together in the application
of aerial images. The report concludes that without additional preprocessing or more
advanced definition of the threshold function the algorithm is of no use
in this application.
