\section{Method}
As a part of "MAA507 - Mathemetics behind internet" at M\"{a}lardalen university
the author choose one algorithm in the field of "Minimum spanning tree and
Image segmentation" as the topic for the project part in the course.
As a main part of analysing the algorithm it was to be shown how the
algorithm can be used in application. As the author had previous experience
with the OpenStreetMap project it was chosen to apply the algorithm to
Bing aerial images.

The work has a strong focus on the single paper that introduced
the algorithm for the first time though with the problems that occured
throughout the segmentation part some other sources have been found that
are more specific to the road recognition objective. More about this in the
conclusions about future work.
