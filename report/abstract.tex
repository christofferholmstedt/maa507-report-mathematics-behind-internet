This report goes through the Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation algorithm
introduced by Pedro F. Felzenswalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher in 2004
and its usefulness on aerial images for road recognition with the purpose of
automating the process to create maps. Written as a part of an advanced level course
this report will give the reader an introduction to some basics of digital
image processing, the algorithm and how it all comes together in the application
of aerial images and road recognition.

The field of digital image processing includes several different subspecialities;
image acquisition, representation, filtering, restoration, segmentation and
recognition to name a few. This work set out to recognise roads though ends up
with poor segmentations. The report concludes that without additional
preprocessing or more advanced definition of the threshold function the
algorithm used with a grid-graph representation of the image is of no use
for road recognition.
