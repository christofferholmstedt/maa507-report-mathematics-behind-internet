Introduction text goes in here. Testing additions here.

\begin{itemize}
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a crowdsourced map built by users collecting gps-traces
and tracing objects through a few aerial imagery sources that are available.
...something about JOSM...
...about this report...
...The structure of this report...
In Appendix more thourough look at OpenStreetMap and Java OpenStreetMap Editor
is given.
In Appendix "How to use implementation"
In Appendix "Algorithm recap, with suggested values for application"

Write about 4/8/Mixed choices and how that can affect.
Define Tau for my use case and explain in the general case.

...notes while reading medical phd report...
Goal with this project is a fully automatic process, no human interaction.


    \item Background OSM why use bing maps? What are they used for? if no or only
        a few gps traces exists they can be used to improve the detail of the 
        open street map.
    \item Problems with using Bing maps?
    \item Images are not photgraphed straight above, this gives us different problems.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Curvy roads
            \item misalignment
            \item
        \end{itemize}
    \item Idea, how to use bing maps, three different questions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Automatically calculate bing aerial imagery offset.
            \item
            \item
        \end{itemize}
    \item So alot of problems with Bing maps and image analysis exists
        we are only to look at the image segmentation problem
        and why speed matters in this application.
